		<p>
			ATLiens, still not inclined to vote?
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are 9 reasons to vote in the primary:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				With fewer people voting, every vote carries more weight.
			</li>
			<li>
				Primaries separates the stronger candidates from weaker ones.
			</li>
			<li>
				Primaries can feature ballot measures that need to be voted on.
			</li>
			<li>
				Primary voters are, generally speaking, older and whiter. They aren’t terribly representative of the full voting population.
			</li>
			<li>
				Primary voters are also more partisan than general election voters, which is how fringe candidates end up in the general.
			</li>
			<li>
				Voter turnout at primaries help determine where campaigns and parties will put more (or less) effort towards the general election. More voting often means more attention and resources.
			</li>
			<li>
				Even if your favorite candidate loses the primary, if s/he gets a good percentage of the votes, there is a good chance the winning candidate will adopt some of their platform to appeal to the broader group of voters.
			</li>
			<li>
				Every time you vote, it becomes more of a habit.
			</li>
			<li>
				Vote in the primary because it is one part of being in a participatory democracy. It’s your right. Use it.
			</li>
		</ol>
